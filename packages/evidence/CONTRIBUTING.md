## Report an Issue

Open issues for bugs, docs improvements or errors.

## Contribute Code

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to test your changes, once you've started the example project (per steps below),
you should be able to open the `Evidence Development Workspace` on `localhost:3000`. Any subsequent changes you make will be reflected on the website.

Open a terminal and make sure `pnpm` is installed with:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

In the project root folder, run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

In the project root folder, run:

```bash
pnpm run sources:example-project
```

In the project root folder, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev:core-components
```

**In another terminal**, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev:example-project
```

#### Cannot find package Error

If you get: `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package [...]`. You might need to clean the `caches`

At the `root` of the project, run:

```bash
rm -rf ./**/.parcel-cache node_modules ./**/dist
```

And reinstall with:

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Running the Test Suite locally.

The automated test suite should run upon PR creation via Github actions.
You can also run the tests locally via `pnpm test`.

**Note that for the DB tests, enviroment variables are needed for the test to run.**

Under each DB package, you can add a `.env` file with the credentials needed for each DB type. Take a look at the `index.cjs` file for the variables required for each DB driver.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome! We review pull requests as they are submitted and will reach out to you with any questions or comments.

Follow these steps to submit a pull request for your changes:

1. Create a fork of the `evidence` repo
2. Commit your changes to your fork
3. Test your changes to make sure all results are as expected
4. Format your code to prevent linting errors `pnpm run format`
5. Add a [changeset](#adding-a-changeset)
6. Open a pull request against the `next` branch of the `evidence` repo

[Here's an example of a pull request](https://github.com/evidence-dev/evidence/pull/165) from a community member who built Evidence's MySQL connector.

#### Adding a Changeset

Changesets ensure that package versions are updated correctly before releasing onto NPM.

1. `cd` to the root of the monorepo
2. `pnpm changeset`
3. Follow the steps in the CLI to add some change notes:
   1. Bump the packages that have changed
   2. Most things are patch changes, not major or minor patch bumps
   3. Unless you're making changes that will break someone's project, or change it in a really unexpected way, just do a patch release
4. Commit the release notes to your branch so they'll be included as part of the PR
   1. the file will be called three random words like delighted-fish-brick.md
