When new versions of Evidence are released, we post release notes in [Slack](https://slack.evidence.dev). You can also take a look at our pull requests on GitHub to see which changes are being made.

We recommend updating regularly to get the latest features and bug fixes. Evidence's is being actively developed, and major releases may introduce breaking changes. We therefore recommend testing updates by running your app in development mode.

## CLI

Run `npm install @evidence-dev/evidence@latest @evidence-dev/core-components@latest`.

## VS Code

Open the command palette and run `Evidence: Update to Latest Version`

## Getting Help

If you run into any problems with updates, reach out on [Slack](https://slack.evidence.dev) or email <support@evidence.dev>.
