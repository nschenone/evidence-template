Evidence supports exporting data and reports to PDF, images, CSVs and using copy-paste.

All of these options are available in both `dev` and `prod` environments.

## PDF

Evidence supports exporting individual pages to PDFs.

Open the option menu in the top-right of the page, and select "Export PDF".

This will open a dialog where you can adjust the format and save.

The PDF reflects the current state of the page - for example if queries are shown, then they will be included in the PDF.

## CSV

Data can be exported as CSV files, using the "Download Data" option in the bottom right of a component.

To see the download option, hover over the component. The following components support CSV downloads:

- Query results
- Tables
- Chart components

The for chart components, the CSV downloaded will match the query that was used in the component.

## Image (PNG)

Charts can be exported as `.png` files, using the "Download image" option in the bottom right of a component.

To see the download option, hover over the component.

## Copy-Paste

You can copy content from Evidence pages and paste it into other applications that support rich text, such as email, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word.

Cmd+A (Mac) or Ctrl+A (Windows) will select all content in the page, excluding the header, footer and sidebar.
