description: Control what is displayed using data with conditional logic.

Programmatically control what is displayed using data through `{#if}` and `{:else}` blocks.

## If and Else Statements

Conditionals are useful for managing information overload, and ensuring that your reporting is consistently showing actionable information.

Conditionals allow you to show a section of your document if a condition is met. You can optionally include `{:else}` and `{:else if}` blocks inside of your `{#if}...{/if}` blocks.

```javascript
{#if condition}

Display some content.

{:else if another condition}

Another thing instead.

{:else }

Something completely different.

{/if}
```

## Example

Hide a table if it is empty.

```javascript
{#if query_name.length !== 0}

<DataTable data={query_name}>

{/if}
```

## Another Example

Imagine creating reports to encourage sales leaders "up-sell" low margin customers, but only when there were enough low-margin customers to do that work in-bulk. This could be done using a conditional.

```javascript
{#if low_margin_customers.length > 15}

The following customers are generating low margins.

Consider re-allocating an account management call block to up-sell these customers.

<DataTable data={low_margin_customers}/>

{:else }

There are fewer than fifteen low margin customers, which is not enough to fill a call block.

{/if}
```
