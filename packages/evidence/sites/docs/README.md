# Evidence Docs

This is the source for Evidence's public documentation.

## Local Installation

From the root of the monorepo, run the following.

```bash
pnpm run docs
```

Note, by default, the development docs site will be running on `localhost:3000` which can collide with the default development port for Evidence. You can circumvent this by specifying the port in the start command, i.e `npm run start -- --port 3001`.
